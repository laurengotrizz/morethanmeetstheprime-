<h1> Hi! I'm LaurenðŸ« ðŸ«¥ðŸ¤“ðŸ‘†ðŸ—¿</h1>
  <h3>Welcome to More than Meets the Prime, a simple blog where I can just obsess over characters from Transformers: Prime!</h3>
</div>
 <h2>The Plot:</h2>
  <p>The series follows the Autobots of "Team Prime," which includes Optimus Prime, Ratchet, Arcee, Bumblebee, and Bulkhead, as well as their human allies, as they seek to safeguard Earth from the nefarious Decepticons and their commander Megatron.</p>

<h2>The Characters:</h2>
  <h6>*Disclaimer: this website is to just express my opinions of these characters and goof about them, I'm not trying to make fun of them. Also this will almost only contain spoilers from season 1, and the colors of the letters represent the characters' affiliations.</h6>

  <div class="gallery">
  <a target="_blank" href="jack.jpg">
    <img src="jack.jpg" alt="Jack" width="250" height="300">
  </a>
  <div class="desc"><span style="color:lightgray">Jack Darby is the "main character". He's pretty dull but somehow gets all the spotlight. He works with Arcee, who is like a mother figure to him.</span></div>
</div>

<div class="gallery">
  <a target="_blank" href="rafaeljorgegonzalezesquivel.jpg">
    <img src="rafaeljorgegonzalezesquivel.jpg" alt="Raf" width="250" height="250">
  </a>
  <div class="desc"><span style="color:lightgray">He's a tech wiz, he's short and extremely relatable. His best friend in Bumblebee, and can even understand him, since he can't really talk.</span></div>
</div>

<div class="gallery">
  <a target="_blank" href="miko.png">
    <img src="miko.png" alt="Miko" width="250" height="300">
  </a>
  <div class="desc"><span style="color:lightgray">She's an exchange student from Japan and is quite the wild card. She's pretty much babysat by Bulkhead.</span></div>
</div>

<div class="gallery">
  <a target="_blank" href="fowler.jpg">
    <img src="fowler.jpg" alt="Agent Fowler" width="250" height="250">
  </a>
  <div class="desc"><span style="color:lightgray">Agent Fowler manages the Autobots while they're in hiding. He's pretty strict, but a bit silly and is pretty much the best human character in the series.</span></div>
</div>

  <div class="gallery">
  <a target="_blank" href="optimus.jpg">
    <img src="optimus.jpg" alt="Optimus Prime" width="300" height="250">
  </a>
  <div class="desc"><span style="color:lightsalmon">Previously known as Orion Pax, Optimus Prime is the leader of the Autobots (big surprise). He's a great leader but is very monotonous. His greatest enemy is Megatron.</span></div>
</div>

  <div class="gallery">
  <a target="_blank" href="motorcyclelady.jpeg">
    <img src="motorcyclelady.jpeg" alt="Arcee" width="250" height="300">
  </a>
    <div class="desc"><span style="color:lightsalmon">Arcee is level headed and a good voice of reason to the other 'bots. She's lost two partners (aka Cliffjumper and Tailgate) and now works with Jack.</span> </div>
  </div>

<div class="gallery">
  <a target="_blank" href="apismellifera.jpeg">
    <img src="apismellifera.jpeg" alt="Bumblebee" width="250" height="300">
  </a>
  <div class="desc"><span style="color:lightsalmon">With his edgy fits from time to time, he's pretty much the teenager of the Autobots. Since Megatron destroyed his voice synthesizer, he can't really talk, but can be easily understood by Raf.</span></div>
</div>

<div class="gallery">
  <a target="_blank" href="bulk.jpg">
    <img src="bulk.jpg" alt="Bulkhead" width="250" height="300">
  </a>
  <div class="desc"><span style="color:lightsalmon">A former Wrecker, Bulkhead is the muscle of the group. He's the best of friends with Wheeljack and is pretty much Miko's guardian.</span></div>
</div>

<div class="gallery">
  <a target="_blank" href="pablo.jpg">
    <img src="pablo.jpg" alt="Pablo- I mean Wheeljack" width="300" height="250">
  </a>
  <div class="desc"><span style="color:lightsalmon">Pablo- I mean Wheeljack is also a former Wrecker and is Bulkhead's best friend. He likes bombs (no, seriously).</span></div>
</div>

<div class="gallery">
  <a target="_blank" href="rat.png">
    <img src="rat.png" alt="Ratchet" width="250" height="250">
  </a>
  <div class="desc"><span style="color:lightsalmon">He's the Autobots' medic. He's very grumpy, and whenever he needs something, Bumblebee and Bulkhead are always there to break it for him. He's known Optimus for a looooooooooonnnnnnng time.</span></div>
</div>

  <div class="gallery">
  <a target="_blank" href="buckethead.jpg">
    <img src="buckethead.jpg" alt="Megatron" width="250" height="300">
  </a>
  <div class="desc"><span style="color:#52307c">Megatron is the leader of the Decepticons and is bent on cyberforming and ruling the entire universe, starting with planet Earth. He was formerly friends with Optimus but is now his greatest enemy.</div>
</div>

<div class="gallery">
  <a target="_blank" href="screamie.jpg">
    <img src="screamie.jpg" alt="Starcream" width="300" height="250">
  </a>
  <div class="desc"><span style="color:#52307c">Starscream is Megatron's number one lackey. He's always trying to overthrow Megatron and reminds me of an anchovy. He's also very annoying.</span></div>
</div>

<div class="gallery">
  <a target="_blank" href="ko is based.jpg">
    <img src="ko is based.jpg" alt="Knockout" width="300" height="250">
  </a>
  <div class="desc"><span style="color:#52307c">Knockout is the medic for the Decepticons and is overall the best character of the series. He is sassy, vain, and cares more about his wax n' paint job then the Decepticon cause. He's frenemies with Starscream.</span></div>
</div>

<div class="gallery">
  <a target="_blank" href="bruh.jpg">
    <img src="bruh.jpg" alt="Breakdown" width="300" height="250">
  </a>
  <div class="desc"><span style="color:#52307c">Similar to Bulkhead, Breakdown is the brawn of the Decepticons. He doesn't really talk much, but is prone to being abducted for not-so-ethical science experiments. Also, he's Knockout's assistant and is in charge of his auto detailing.</span></div>
</div>

  <div class="gallery">
  <a target="_blank" href="spidey.jpg">
    <img src="spidey.jpg" alt="Airachnid" width="300" height="250">
  </a>
  <div class="desc"><span style="color:#52307c">Arcee's number one rival, Airachnid can turn into a spider and a helicopter. She isn't very trustworthy and will probably stab you in the back when you least expect it (Starscream beware). </span></div>
</div>

  <div class="gallery">
  <a target="_blank" href="soundwave.jpeg">
    <img src="soundwave.jpeg" alt="Soundwave" width="250" height="250">
  </a>
  <div class="desc"><span style="color:#52307c">Soundwave is just- Soundwave. He sees everything, hears everything, and is probably in your walls. He doesn't talk, but he has cool forks-for-arms that make up for it a thousandfold.</span></div>
</div>

  <p>And so, this is the end of the blog (sad right?). As I mentioned before, I am only mentioning reccuring characters in the first season of Transformers: Prime. If you want to watch the complete show, go to the official Transformers channel, linked <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCx7b66RpQRLuOXvItxy0Wxg">here</a>.</p>
